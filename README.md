## Project Title
* InclusiJob: A Mobile Solution for Employment and Inclusivity for Persons with Disabilities, Senior Citizens, Youth, and Marginalized Sector

## Background of the Study
* InclusiJob aims to address the employment challenges faced by Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), Senior Citizens, Youth, and Marginalized Sectors. Current job platforms, like LinkedIn, present various barriers, including limited accessibility features, a complex interface for senior citizens, and inadequate job filters for marginalized users. These issues contribute to socioeconomic isolation and difficulty in finding meaningful employment. InclusiJob seeks to bridge this gap by providing a mobile application designed to meet the needs of these specific groups.

## Problems with Existing Job Platforms (e.g., LinkedIn):
* Limited Accessibility for PWDs: Lack of screen reader compatibility and workplace accessibility information.
* Complex Interface for Senior Citizens: Difficult navigation due to complex features.
* Barriers for Marginalized Youth: Emphasis on experience and education, with limited entry-level opportunities.
* Inadequate Job Filters: No filters for accessibility, remote work, or job flexibility.
## Project Objectives
* The primary objective of InclusiJob is to develop a mobile application that provides an accessible and user-friendly job search experience for PWDs, senior citizens, youth, and marginalized sectors. Key goals include:

## Developing a user-centered mobile application.
* Simplifying the user interface for senior citizens.
Offering tailored job recommendations for youth, focusing on entry-level positions and internships.
Incorporating advanced accessibility features and personalized job filters.
Creating a seamless job search experience for improved employment access.
## Expected Outputs
InclusiJob will produce a mobile app that is reliable, user-friendly, and accessible to diverse populations. The expected features include:

* Accessibility: Screen reader compatibility, text resizing, and color contrast options for PWDs.
Simplified UI for Senior Citizens: Large fonts, easy navigation, and focus on flexible job opportunities.
Job Resources for Youth: Career guidance and access to entry-level jobs and internships.
Advanced Job Filters: Users can filter job listings based on accessibility, remote work, flexibility, and location preferences.

InclusiJob addresses the need for inclusive employment solutions, offering the following benefits:

* Job Seekers & Employers: A user-friendly platform for finding and hiring staff with accessibility needs.
Government Agencies & NGOs: Helps organizations promote employment fairness and support beneficiaries in finding jobs.
* Caregivers, Families & Advocacy Groups: Supports PWDs, seniors, and marginalized individuals in achieving independence through employment.

* Senior Citizens: Individuals aged 60 and above seeking flexible and accessible job opportunities.
* Youth: Individuals aged 15-24 looking for entry-level jobs and career guidance.
* Marginalized Sectors: Groups that do not receive adequate attention from government services.
